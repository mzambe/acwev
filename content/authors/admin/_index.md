I am a postdoc at **UC Berkeley** working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/?_ga=2.197307247.1385266317.1635523834-1227136600.1633315763"> **Raluca Ada Popa** </a> and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/"> **Alessandro Chiesa** </a>. My research interests include Cryptography and Post-Quantum Cryptography, Computational Complexity Theory and Algorithms.

I completed my Ph.D. at **MIT**, where I was advised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/"> **Vinod Vaikuntanathan** </a>. I received a Master of Science at MIT under the supervision of <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/">**Ronald L. Rivest**</a>. Before MIT, I was an undergraduate student at the Department of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences at **National Technical University of Athens** where I worked work with <a href="http://www.math.ntua.gr/~symvonis/" >**Antonios Symvonis**</a>.

I was an intern at IDC Herzliya with <a href="https://www.alonrosen.net" >**Alon Rosen** </a>, and at Microsoft Research, Redmond with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/esghosh/" >**Esha Ghosh** </a>. I was awarded the <a href="https://www.chateaubriand-fellowship.org/2017-82.html">Chateaubriand Fellowship</a>, and the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Kanellakis">Paris C.
