I am a postdoc at UC Berkley working with Raluca Ada Popa and Alessandro Chiesa . My research interests include Cryptography and Post - Quantum Cryptography, Computational Complexity Theory and Algorithms.

I completed my PhD at MIT, where I was advised by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. I received a Master of Sience at MIT under the supervision of Ron Rivest. Before MIT, I was an undergrad student at the Department of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences at National Technical University of Athens where I worked work with Antonios Symvonis.

During the Ph.D., I worked as an intern at IDC Herzliya with Alon Rosen, and at MSR, Redmond with Esha Ghosh. I was awarded the Chateaubriand Fellowship, and the Paris C. Kanellakis Fellowship.
